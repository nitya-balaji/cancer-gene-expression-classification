- `labels.csv` - Cancer type labels for each sample (5 classes: BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD)

## Download Instructions

The dataset is sourced from **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)** via Kaggle.

**To run this project:**
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: [Insert your specific Kaggle dataset link here]
2. Extract the files
3. Place `data.csv` and `labels.csv` in this directory
4. Run the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/cancer_analysis.ipynb`

**Please Note:** 
Due to GitHub's file size limitations (data.csv > 100MB), the raw data files are not included in this repository.
